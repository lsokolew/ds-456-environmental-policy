# ds-456-environmental-policy

Group Members: Alicia Severiano Perez, Sydney Ohr, Lilabeth Sokolewicz

Our project focuses on the topic of environmental justice, which aims to avoid disproportionate environmental and health impacts on marginalized communities, as well as taking the wellbeing and voice of all people into account when creating environmental policy. 

Our research quesiton concerns the locations of Minnesota powerplants and their effects on surrounding communities, quanitified through demographics, air quality, and health outcomes. 


Description of Files:
  1. The 'Data" folder consists of all the data used for this analysis
  2. The 'ui.R' file organizes the layout of the shiny app, that being the plots, text, and sidebar
  3. The 'server.r' file is where the code for the plots are stored
  4. The 'app.R' file is where the ui render function lives
  5. The 'set_code.R' file is where we load in and wrangle data that will be used for plots
